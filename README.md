This is the code behind my website, [josh-palmer.com](http://josh-palmer.com). 

### Prior to Building
A couple of required files are not checked into Git, but I left some example files to act as templates.
Each example file has its own set of instructions for how to use it. It should be as easy as renaming the file and 
pasting your own data in it.

### Requirements
- Node.js
- ReactJS
- [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app)
- See package.json for the other npm dependencies.

### Building
create-react-app should come with all the instructions for building, but here are the basics:
- `npm start` to start the dev server. The website will load in the default browser and get updated automatically as you make changes.
- `npm run-script build` to build the production code. Final output gets saved to the `build` directory.
